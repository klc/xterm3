**xterm3** is a terminal emulator for Flutter applications, on mobile and
desktop. It ships a headless emulation core with no Flutter dependency and a
renderer on top of it, so the terminal can be driven — and tested — without a
widget tree.

It continues the line that started with
[`xterm`](https://pub.dev/packages/xterm) from
[`TerminalStudio/xterm.dart`](https://github.com/TerminalStudio/xterm.dart) and
was kept alive as [`xterm2`](https://pub.dev/packages/xterm2). The original
package is unmaintained, and `xterm2` has since diverged far enough —
rewritten renderer, reworked buffer and reflow, new input and search paths —
that it continues here under its own name. `xterm2` users migrate by changing
the dependency and the package in imports; the public API is unchanged.

> Requires Flutter >= 3.19.0

## Performance

Same workloads, same harness, three packages. Every number below is
reproducible from `script/cross_bench/`, which depends on all three at once and
drives each through its headless `core.dart` — so nothing per-package sits in
the measured path.

`xterm` 4.0.0 · `xterm2` 5.2.0 · `xterm3` 6.3.0. Grid 170x50, 10000 lines of
scrollback, 32 MiB per workload in 8 KiB chunks, AOT-compiled, one package per
process, three interleaved rounds. Apple M1 Pro, macOS 26.5.1, Dart 3.12.2.

**Write throughput, MiB/s** — higher is better:

| workload | `xterm` | `xterm2` | `xterm3` | vs `xterm` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| plain ASCII output | 15.8 | 86.6 | **113.4** | **7.2x** |
| lines wider than the window | 16.6 | 117.8 | **135.5** | **8.2x** |
| SGR-heavy (coloured) output | 18.8 | **60.8** | 57.4 | 3.1x |
| UTF-8 (Turkish) | 15.4 | 14.2 | **63.5** | **4.1x** |
| Cyrillic | 14.8 | 5.5 | **90.4** | **6.1x** |
| alt-screen TUI redraw | 19.2 | 133.2 | **139.1** | **7.2x** |

**Scrollback residency, MiB** — 10000 lines of `ls -l`-shaped output retained
at a 170-column window; lower is better:

| | `xterm` | `xterm2` | `xterm3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| resident scrollback | 85.8 | 79.3 | **52.8** |

**Resize reflow, ms** — one 170 → 80 → 170 column pair with the scrollback
full, rewrapping all 10000 retained lines twice; lower is better:

| | `xterm` | `xterm2` | `xterm3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| per resize | 10.6 | 4.7 | **4.6** |

Two rows are worth reading honestly rather than as a scoreboard. **SGR output
is 6% slower than `xterm2`** — a known price of sizing line storage from what a
line actually writes, which is what buys the scrollback row; the alternatives
were measured at -22% and -14% elsewhere. And **reflow is level with `xterm2`**;
the 2.3x there is against `xterm`, not against the immediate predecessor.

The large gaps are on non-ASCII text, and they are structural: both older
packages leave the batched write path at the first accented letter, so a
language not written in ASCII never batches at all. `xterm2` is *slower* than
`xterm` on Cyrillic for that reason — the rest of its write path got faster
around a per-code-point loop that did not.

Renderer frame times, the workloads behind them, and every change that was
measured and **rejected** are in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md). Nothing in
this package is accepted on the argument that it ought to be faster.

## Screenshots

Every image below is a real frame painted by `TerminalView`, produced by
`example/lib/screenshot.dart` from PTY recordings in
`example/assets/screenshots/` — so they can be regenerated rather than
retouched. Grid 100x30, Cascadia Mono at 13pt.

## Features

- 📦 **Works out of the box.** No special configuration required.
- ✔ **Frontend independent.** The emulation core runs without Flutter —
  `package:xterm3/core.dart` has no `dart:ui` on any path.
- 😀 **Unicode 17.** Wide characters, grapheme clusters, emoji sequences, and
  a batched write path that covers Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Armenian rather
  than ASCII alone.
- 🔍 **Search.** Bounded, Unicode-aware, across soft wraps, with a distinct
  active match — `Terminal.search`.
- 🔗 **Hyperlinks.** OSC 8, plus plain `http(s)://` and `www.` text detected in
  the buffer. Modifier-click on desktop, tap on touch.
- 🎨 **Procedural glyphs.** Box drawing, blocks, mosaics, Braille and Powerline
  drawn directly, so they tile without font seams at any cell size.
- 🔤 **Ligatures.** Opt-in via `TerminalStyle(enableLigatures: true)` with a
  ligature-capable font such as Fira Code, JetBrains Mono or Iosevka. A
  ligature is drawn only where it fills exactly the cells it covers, so the
  grid never shifts; anything else falls back to per-cell painting.
- 🖱 **Mouse reporting.** DEC modes 1000/1002/1003 with normal, UTF-8, SGR,
  SGR-pixel and urxvt encodings; extended buttons, horizontal wheel, and
  Shift+wheel scrollback that survives an application grabbing the mouse.
- ⌨️ **Modern key encoding.** Kitty keyboard protocol, fixterms chords, and
  correct modified arrows, function keys, Enter and Escape.
- 🈂️ **IME-aware.** Composition is held back until the keyboard commits it, in
  both delete-detection modes — Turkish and CJK text arrives once, correctly.
- 🧭 **Semantic prompts.** OSC 133/633 anchors tracked across scrollback and
  reflow, with shortcuts to jump between them.
- ⏱ **Paced writing.** `PacedTerminalWriter` feeds PTY output a frame's worth
  at a time: a burst drains ~50% slower and stays at 75fps instead of 37.
- 🎛 **Runtime theming**, synchronized output (DEC 2026), DECSCUSR cursor
  shapes, focus reporting, and OSC 7 working-directory updates.

## Getting Started

**1.** Add the [package from pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/xterm3):

```sh
flutter pub add xterm3
```

or add it to your package's pubspec.yaml file by hand:

```yml
dependencies:
  ...
  xterm3: ^6.3.0
```

**2.** Create the terminal:

```dart
import 'package:xterm3/xterm.dart';
...
terminal = Terminal();
```

Listen to user interaction with the terminal by simply adding a `onOutput` callback:

```dart
terminal = Terminal();

terminal.onOutput = (output) {
  print('output: $output');
}
```

**3.** Create the view, attach the terminal to the view:

```dart
import 'package:xterm3/flutter.dart';
...
child: TerminalView(terminal),
```

**4.** Write something to the terminal:

```dart
terminal.write('Hello, world!');
```

**Done!**

## More examples

- Write a simple terminal in ~100 lines of code:
  https://github.com/klc/xterm3/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart

- Write a SSH client in ~100 lines of code with [dartssh2]:
  https://github.com/klc/xterm3/blob/master/example/lib/ssh.dart

- Regenerate the screenshots above:
  `python3 script/screenshots/record.py`, then
  `cd example && flutter run --release -d macos -t lib/screenshot.dart`

For the original package history, see [TerminalStudio/xterm.dart].

## Migrating from `xterm2`

The public API is unchanged. Three mechanical edits:

- `xterm2: ^5.3.0` becomes `xterm3: ^6.3.0` in `pubspec.yaml`.
- `package:xterm2/...` becomes `package:xterm3/...` in imports. The entry point
  keeps its name: `import 'package:xterm3/xterm.dart';`.
- `XTERM2_FUZZ_ROUNDS` becomes `XTERM3_FUZZ_ROUNDS`.

Note the licence change below: `xterm2` 5.3.0 and earlier are MIT, `xterm3`
6.0.0 and later are AGPL.
