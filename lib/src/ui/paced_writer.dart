/// Writes PTY output into a [Terminal] a frame's worth at a time, so a burst
/// of output cannot hold the UI thread for longer than [frameBudget].
///
/// Handing every chunk straight to [Terminal.write] as it arrives parses the
/// whole burst at whatever rate the machine manages, and frames happen in the
/// gaps. On a 170x50 grid, 32 MiB of `cat`-style output measured 566ms to
/// drain and 37 frames per second while it did. The same burst through this
/// writer with the default budget measured 854ms and 75 frames per second -
/// the display's full refresh rate.
///
/// So this is a trade, not a free win: **output drains around 50% slower and
/// the terminal stays smooth while it does.** Which one is right depends on
/// the application. Nothing in the package uses this by default.

/// and nothing is dropped. There is no back pressure - pending chunks are held
/// until they can be parsed, exactly as the PTY stream's own buffer would hold
